Hello,

This is a kindly warning regarding your usage of Intelligence search quota in VT Enterprise.

You have consumed $warn_rate % ($quota_used) of your allowed quota ($quota_allowed) for this week of the month.
If you exceed your allowed quota, your account will be automatically removed from $company_name subscription until next week.

To prevent exceeding your weekly quota, only use Intelligence Search (the default search through GUI) when needed (i.e. when you need advanced filters).

Consider using the VT4Browser extension (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002700745-Browser-Extensions) or CLI (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006819798-API-Scripts-and-client-libraries#h_10f07166-4521-4730-9910-da4e810ffaf1) when only IOC lookup is needed.
See the following documentation about the browser extension usage https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413290242705-VT4Browsers-4-0
