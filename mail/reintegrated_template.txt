Hello,

Your current Intelligence search quota is $current_search_quota with a current usage of $current_search_usage. 
Your current Intelligence download quota is $current_download_quota with a current usage of $current_download_usage

You were removed because your consumption of Intelligence search or Intelligence download exceeded your weekly quota.

To prevent exceeding your weekly quota, only use Intelligence Search (the default search through GUI) when needed (i.e. when you need advanced filters).

Consider using the VT4Browser extension (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002700745-Browser-Extensions) or CLI (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006819798-API-Scripts-and-client-libraries#h_10f07166-4521-4730-9910-da4e810ffaf1) when only IOC lookup is needed.

See the following documentation about the browser extension usage https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413290242705-VT4Browsers-4-0
