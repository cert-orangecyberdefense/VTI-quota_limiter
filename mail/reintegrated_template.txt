Hello,

Your account has been automatically reintegrated in the VT Enterprise $company_name group. Your current quota is $current_quota with a current usage of $current_usage.

You were removed because your consumption of Intelligence search exceeded your weekly quota.

To prevent exceeding your weekly quota, only use Intelligence Search (the default search through GUI) when needed (i.e. when you need advanced filters).

Consider using the VT4Browser extension (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002700745-Browser-Extensions) or CLI (https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006819798-API-Scripts-and-client-libraries#h_10f07166-4521-4730-9910-da4e810ffaf1) when only IOC lookup is needed.

See the following documentation about the browser extension usage https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413290242705-VT4Browsers-4-0
